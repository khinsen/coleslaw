# coleslaw

**Fork note:** This is my personal fork, which mainly adds a comment-via-Mastodon feature, and tweaks the URLs to match those of the generator I used before (Frog). Once comments-via-Mastodon work to my satisfaction, I will see if I can refactor this feature as a plugin and submit it upstream. For now, consider this fork under construction and use at your own risk.

Coleslaw is Flexible Lisp Blogware similar to [Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), or [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/).

Have questions? 
- IRC in **#coleslaw** on Freenode!
- Subscribe to the mailing list [**coleslaw@common-lisp.net**](https://mailman.common-lisp.net/listinfo/coleslaw).

See the [wiki](https://github.com/redline6561/coleslaw/wiki/Example-sites) for a list of coleslaw-powered blogs.

Coleslaw should run on any conforming Common Lisp implementations but
testing is primarily done on [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org/) and [CCL](http://ccl.clozure.com/).

## Installation/Tutorial

<!-- Don't let the first user select from multiple choises -->

Step 1: Install this library.

```
$ ros install coleslaw-org/coleslaw      # With [Roswell](https://roswell.github.io/)
$ export PATH="$HOME/.roswell/bin:$PATH" # If you haven't done this before for Roswell
or
CL-USER> (ql:quickload :coleslaw-cli)
```

Step 2: Initialize your blog repository.

``` 
$ mkdir yourblog ; cd yourblog
$ git init
$ coleslaw setup              # or
CL-USER> (coleslaw-cli:setup)
```

`coleslaw setup` / `(coleslaw-cli:setup)` will generate a `.coleslawrc` file in
the current directory, which contains the configuration of the static website.

Step 3: Write a post file in the current directory.
The file should contain a certain metadata, so use the `coleslaw new` command,
which instantiates a correct file for you.

```
$ coleslaw new
Created a post 2017-11-06.post .
# or 
CL-USER> (coleslaw-cli:new "post")
Created a post 2017-11-06.post .
```

Step 4: Generate the site from those post files.
The result goes to the *staging directory* specified in the `.coleslawrc` file.
The staging directory is `/tmp/coleslaw/` by default.

```
$ coleslaw          # or
$ coleslaw generate # or
$ coleslaw stage    # or
CL-USER> (coleslaw-cli:generate) ; or
CL-USER> (coleslaw-cli:stage)    ; --- these are all aliases
```

Step 5: You can launch a web server to check the result on a browser.
(Running a webserver sometimes has a benefit over just opening an html file,
e.g. the relative links behaves differently on a file:/// protocol)

```
$ coleslaw preview     # or
CL-USER> (coleslaw-cli:preview)
```

Step 6: and watch the file system to automatically regenerate the site!

```
$ coleslaw watch          # or even better,
$ coleslaw watch-preview  # or, on REPL,
CL-USER> (coleslaw-cli:watch)      ;; watch-preview does not work on REPL right now
```

Step 7: When you think your article is publishable, run

```
$ coleslaw deploy             # or
CL-USER> (coleslaw-cli:deploy)
```

To move the contents in the staging dir to the deploy dir.
By default, this deploy command uses `rsync` to sync the directories,
where the deploy dir could be a remote directory on the server which is running your website.
By using a plugin, you can customize this behavior e.g. running the deploy on gh-pages.

For further customization, e.g. adding a new plugin, developing a new plugin, changing the deploy option, or creating a new theme,
see the [config docs](docs).

We provide three default themes: hyde, the default, and readable (based on
[bootswatch readable](http://bootswatch.com/readable/)).

A core goal of *coleslaw* is to be both pleasant to read and easy to
hack on and extend. If you want to understand the internals and bend
*coleslaw* to do new and interesting things, I strongly encourage you
to read the [Hacker's Guide to Coleslaw][hackers]. You'll find some
current **TODO** items towards the bottom.
